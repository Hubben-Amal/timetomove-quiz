## How it works
This is a [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) app for an online quiz.
In the file [`public/screens.yml`](public/screens.yml) the structure of the quiz is specified in the [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) markup language.
The app gets build automatically when files change and is published at https://hubben-amal.github.io/timetomove-quiz/

### Elements
#### Options
```yml
options:
  score: 10
```

Here you specify the number of questions in the quiz.
#### Screen
```yml
identifier: 
  type: screen
  text: |-
    The content shown in the screen
  next: <identifier of next element>
  next_text: Text to display on the button
```

Every screen starts with an **identifier** which has to be unique. 
This allows us to set up how the user will move through the quiz.
The `screen` element has these properties:
*  `type`: type of the element (`screen`)
*  `text`: the content to show in the screen, you can use the [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) markup language
*  `next`: the **identifier** of the next element. At the bottom of the screen there will be a button which will navigate to this element
*  `next_text`: the text in the button

#### Question

```yml
identifier: 
  type: question
  question: >-
    The question shown
  next: <identifier of next element>
  options: 
    - text: Option 1
      result: true
    - text: Option 2
      result: false
    ...
```
Every question starts with an **identifier** which has to be unique. 
This allows us to set up how the user will move through the quiz.
The `question` element has these properties:
*  `type`: type of the element (`question`)
*  `question`: the content to show in the question (i.e. the question itself), you can use the [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) markup language
*  `next`: the **identifier** of the next element. At the bottom of the screen there will be a button which will navigate to this element
*  `options`: An array with the multiple choice options for the question
   *  `text`: Write the option here
   *  `result`: Set to `true` or `false` depending on whether the option is correct.
#### End
```yml 
identifier: 
  type: end
  text: |-
    The content shown in the end screen
  submit: <link to submit>
  submit_text: Text on the submit button
``` 

The end screen starts with an **identifier** which has to be unique. 
This allows us to set up how the user will move through the quiz.
The `end` element has these properties:
*  `type`: type of the element (`end`)
*  `text`: the content to show in the end screen, you can use the [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) markup language
*  `submit`: A link to a form to submit details to be able to pick winners for prizes.
*  `submit_text`: the text in the button
