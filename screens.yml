    Funnily enough the **United Kingdom** seemed to have as hard of a time joining the EU than it has leaving it.
    It was only in 1973 when it officially joined the union. 
    Although it made efforts to be an EU member, France rejected its application, not just once, but twice. 
    French President Charles de Gaulle rejected and vetoed the British application both in 1963 and in 1967.

    ## Which country holds the title of 'Largest beer consumer'?
  next: q_3_answer
  options: 
    - text: Czech Republic
      result: true

  text: |-
    ## This title goes out the The Czech Republic!

    In 2015, the most recent year for which statistics are available, the Czechs drank 142.4 litres per person. 
    That's the equivalent of 250 pints or one every 35 hours. 
    But, given that minors are unlikely to be contributing to that figure, it's safe to assume that the average beer drinker probably guzzles quite a bit more.
    
    Full statistics are:
      1. The Czech Republic - **142,4** l/p
      2. Germany - **107,0** l/p 
      3. Ireland - **79,0**  l/p
      4. Belgium - **72,0** l/p
